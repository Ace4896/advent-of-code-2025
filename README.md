# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my personal solutions for Advent of Code 2025.

## Running Solution Code

My solutions are written in Rust. Wanted to practice it as I haven't used it in a while.

- Install Rust Stable 1.91 or higher
- Run `cargo run --bin dayX`, e.g. `day1` for the 1st day

## Notes

- I tried to solve everything in one pass without looking at hints/answers. If something seems super convoluted, it's probably because I missed something obvious and/or wasn't aware of the optimal algorithm
- String manipulation in Rust is tricky as always
